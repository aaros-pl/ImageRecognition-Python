# The rozpoZNAK application - first part

> This is part of the application used to recognize road signs using python and java android. 

## Getting Started

> The repository contains two _fake_data.py_ files and the _server_ folder. _fake_data.py_ is designed to convert input images to the gray scale, and rotate them by angles from -11 to 9 degrees. FIle _fake_data_2.py_ resizes all input data to one specified in the size file (e.g 200 x 200 pixels)

### Setup

Python scripts simply download and run in the IDE or console (creating a Python virtual environment). They are helpful when processing large amounts of data in a relatively short time (.jpeg, .png, .jpg, .gif, .txt).

When you run in the console, do it by make virtual environment: 
```
mkvirtualenv fake_data
```
